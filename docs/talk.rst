    NetworkX is comparatively very inefficient, but it is trivial to install --- requiring no compilation at all, since it is pure python. 
    Thus one can get started with very little to no effort. The speed may not be a problem if one is dealing with very small graphs, and does not care 
    if an algorithm runs in, say, 1 or 30 seconds. However, if the graph size increases to hundreds of thousands, or millions of vertices/edges, this difference can scale up quickly.
